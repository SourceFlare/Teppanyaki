# Teppanyaki
Teppanyaki is a Recipe Dispatcher written in PHP that will run primarily on the command line, but can also integrate into PHP web stacks.

It offers a bare-bones environment to slice 'n' dice data, then output it into useful formats... you write the recipe, the cook does the work!

### Provided Examples

##### 1. 5 Day Forecast Location Data
##### 2. 3-Hourly Forecast Location Date
##### 3. Hourly Observations (Near-Real-Time)

All three of these take the main all-in-one API files from MetOffice Datapoint, and transpile them into JSON files for each of the 5,000+ UK locations.

### Other use cases
You could use Teppanyaki to log actions from your system or web stack, process emails, package files, light database operations, etc.
